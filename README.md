# ROAD TRANSPORT ACCIDENTS IN NIGERIA

In this project, I will be analyzing road accidents dataset for the year 2023 to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors. The goal is to gain insights into the causes 
of road accidents and develop strategies for accident prevention and mitigation. The dataset was gotten from the National Bureau of Statistics website. 
**Important Note**: The data is divided into quarters for each year. For 2023 we have 4 datasets in different categories representing the four quarters in the year. Before analysis, 
I will be merging the datasets into one.
